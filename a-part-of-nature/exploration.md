# Synopsis
There are many ways to explore biodiversity. By far the most valuable approach is to go out and explore the reality of nature. The aim of this section is to help prepare for such explorations and to support data collection efforts.

# Modules
## Names
One way to explore biodiversity is to enter the realm of [names](/a-part-of-nature/exploration/names). To help us communicate about a particular object, we give it a name. If the name is accepted by a group, it becomes a common name. The name might spread to other communities or the object has already been given another name. Through time some names are retained and others are forgotten. With science and the study of living organisms, the naming became more complex. First organisms are described and grouped by their appearance. If they look alike they become a morphological species of organisms and receive a scientific name. With more and more described organisms scientists started to organize species into larger groups, again according to their similarity - expressed by their shared traits. In the course of time, species were described independently by different scientists and received different names. The quest for the name of a particular life form - a unit of biodiversity - is not a trivial one. Even today, with a vast web of information at our disposal, the identification of common and scientific names remains complicated. To facilitate the exploration of the realm of names and to identify particular names is the aim of this module.

## Keys
[Keys](/a-part-of-nature/exploration/keys) can be considered a guide to identifying members of certain groups of biodiversity. They are based on attributes inherent to these groups. There are many species concepts and each of them could probably be used to model a key. Keys can be modelled around any combination of groups which posess attributes that can be used to distinguish them. A key can be designed merely from available data OR to fit a particular concept. The quality of attribues can be determined by measuring their instability i.e. their range of variation or their stability i.e. lack of variation. Thus not all observable attributes are informative. 

Classical keys are usually based on morphological traits that can be perceived without (or only limited) technolgical means. Additionally, these keys focus on certain taxonomic or geographic groups and assume that the specimen is whole and / or in a certain developmental stage. As morphological species are established by a generalized description of a species (as whole), the successful identification of specimens requires all diagnostic features to be available. By introducing constraints / filters (geographic, temporal, ecological) and subsequent re-evaluation of the diagnostic feature domain, identifications with a fraction of original features are possible.

The development of such keys and the implementation of a **keymaker** is the aim of this module.
### Example
A specimen was observed at a specific location and time of the year. The location is associated with a particular biotope
