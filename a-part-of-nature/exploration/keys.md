<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Keys -->

# Synopsis
Keys can be considered a guide to identifying members of certain groups of biodiversity. They are based on attributes inherent to these groups. There are many species concept and each of them could probably be used to model a key. Keys can be modelled around any combination of groups which posess attributes that can be used to distinguish them. A key can be designed merely by the available data OR to fit a particular concept. The quality of attribues can be determined by measuring their instability i.e. their range of variation or their stability i.e. lack of variation. Thus not all observable attributes are informative. The development of such keys and the implementation of a **keymaker** is the aim of this module.
