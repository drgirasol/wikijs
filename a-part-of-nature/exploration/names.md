# Synopsis
One way to explore biodiversity is to enter the realm of names. To help us communicate about a particular object, we give it a name. If the name is accepted by a group, it becomes a common name for that object. The name might spread to other communities or the object has already been given another name. Through time some names are retained and others are forgotten. With science and the study of living organisms, the naming became more complex. First organisms are described and grouped by their appearance. If they look alike they become a species of organisms and receive a scientific name. With more and more described organisms scientists started to organize species into larger groups, again according to their similarity - expressed by their shared traits. In the course of time, species were described independently by different scientists and received different names. The quest for the name of a particular life form - a unit of biodiversity - is not a trivial one. Even today, with a vast web of information at our disposal, the identification of common and scientific names remains complicated. To facilitate the exploration of the realm of names and to identify particular names is the aim of this module.
