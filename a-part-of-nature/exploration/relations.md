# Synopsis
You look like your father - one way to recognize a relationship between individuals is by their appearance. If we look at all living organisms and group them by what we can perceive as a general appearance we get the basic units of biodiversity. If we organize these units into larger groups using a similar principle we get a hierarchy that depicts the relationsship in terms of appearance between the basic and larger units of biodiversity. 

There are several sources that offer hierarchical data. The Tree of Life Web Project (TOLweb) and the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL). The TOLweb hierarchy is better described as a phylogeny. In regard of plants the phlogeneitc tree ends at the family level. EOL offers hierarchies of different data providers (e.g. NCBI Taxonomy, Species 2000 & ITIS Catalogue of Life, etc.) down to the basic units. Since we are interested in viewing relationships primarily in a morphological sense but want to include different perspectives as well, it is crucial to know what the basis of any hierarchy or phylogeny is. To implement a **relations viewer** is the aim of this module.
