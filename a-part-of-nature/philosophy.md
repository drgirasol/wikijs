# Spark
The following is my personal philosophy. It does not necessarily define where the project is going but should be meaningful in regard of my contributions to it.

* We are not in control. We don't choose where we are born, who our parents are or what we are tought. But we have the capacity to think and reflect.
* We are limited. We can chose from a pool of options that is regionally, socially or politically limited.
* We all have the same fundamental needs.
