# Spark
The following is my personal philosophy. It does not necessarily define where the project is going but should be meaningful in regard of my contributions to it.

* We are not in control. We don't choose where we are born, who our parents are or what we are tought. But we have the capacity to think and reflect.
* We are limited. We can chose from a pool of options that is regionally, socially or politically limited. And we are human. We can try to bridge the limit by technology, but we remain limited. Thus every bridge has its price.
* We all have the same fundamental needs. Many of which we share with other life forms.
