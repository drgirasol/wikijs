<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Ontologies -->

# Ontologies
## General
* [schema.org](https://schema.org/): Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model.
* [The National Center for Biomedical Ontology](https://www.bioontology.org/)
* [Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge - SEEK](http://seek.ecoinformatics.org/Wiki.jsp%3Fpage=SEEKObservationOntology.html): A system designed to facilitate not only data acquisition and archiving, but integrating, transforming, analyzing, and synthesizing ecological and biodiversity data that was previously intractable.
* [OBO - Phenotypic quality](http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/pato.html): Phenotypic qualities (properties). This ontology can be used in conjunction with other ontologies such as GO or anatomical ontologies to refer to phenotypes. Examples of qualities are red, ectopic, high temperature, fused, small, edematous and arrested.
## Plants
* [A Terminological Resource for Plant Functional Diversity](http://www.top-thesaurus.org): TOP, a Thesaurus Of Plant characteristics, defines standards for a functional approach to plant diversity by stabilizing the terminology for concepts widely used in ecology and evolution. TOP provides names, definitions, formal units and synonyms for more than 700 plant characteristics: plant traits and environmental associations.
* [OBO - Plant Ontology](http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/po.html): The Plant Ontology is a structured vocabulary and database resource that links plant anatomy, morphology and growth and development to plant genomics data. The PO is under active development to expand to encompass terms and annotations from all plants.
# Visualization
* [jOWL](http://jowl.ontologyonline.org/): jOWL is a jQuery plugin for navigating and visualising OWL-RDFS documents.
* [WebVOWL](http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl.html): WebVOWL is a web application for the interactive visualization of ontologies. It implements the Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies (VOWL) by providing graphical depictions for elements of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) that are combined to a force-directed graph layout representing the ontology. Interaction techniques allow to explore the ontology and to customize the visualization. The VOWL visualizations are automatically generated from JSON files into which the ontologies need to be converted. A Java-based OWL2VOWL converter is provided along with WebVOWL.
