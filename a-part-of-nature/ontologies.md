<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Ontologies -->

# Ontologies
* [The National Center for Biomedical Ontology](https://www.bioontology.org/)
* [Science Environment for Ecological Knowledge - SEEK](http://seek.ecoinformatics.org/Wiki.jsp%3Fpage=SEEKObservationOntology.html): A system designed to facilitate not only data acquisition and archiving, but integrating, transforming, analyzing, and synthesizing ecological and biodiversity data that was previously intractable.
* [OBO - Phenotypic quality](http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/pato.html): Phenotypic qualities (properties). This ontology can be used in conjunction with other ontologies such as GO or anatomical ontologies to refer to phenotypes. Examples of qualities are red, ectopic, high temperature, fused, small, edematous and arrested.
## Plants
* [A Terminological Resource for Plant Functional Diversity](http://www.top-thesaurus.org): TOP, a Thesaurus Of Plant characteristics, defines standards for a functional approach to plant diversity by stabilizing the terminology for concepts widely used in ecology and evolution. TOP provides names, definitions, formal units and synonyms for more than 700 plant characteristics: plant traits and environmental associations.
* [OBO - Plant Ontology](http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/po.html): The Plant Ontology is a structured vocabulary and database resource that links plant anatomy, morphology and growth and development to plant genomics data. The PO is under active development to expand to encompass terms and annotations from all plants.
# Visualization
* [jOWL](http://jowl.ontologyonline.org/): jOWL is a jQuery plugin for navigating and visualising OWL-RDFS documents.
