# Server-side
## Development
* [Angular](https://angular.io/): Angular (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular 2") is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address all of the parts of the developer's workflow while building complex web applications. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/): PHP framework
* [sproutcore](http://sproutcore.com/): SproutCore is the original JavaScript MVC library, kicking off the JS-MVC movement in 2007. Developed by Apple and maintained by a robust and growing community, it continues to power the web application revolution. More than a plugin, it builds on top of JavaScript to provide an application-style runtime and MVC object model inspired by the best ideas from Cocoa.
## Data annotation & integration
* [Metacat](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/docs/): Metacat is a repository for data and metadata (documentation about data) that helps scientists find, understand and effectively use data sets they manage or that have been created by others.
## Geographic Information System
* [Web Map Service](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service): Wiki Page on Web Map Service
  * [Mappu](http://unicolet.github.io/mappu/): Mappu is a web-based GIS built on the awesome Sproutcore platform which just runs on top of your existing WMS server and makes it easy to browse, print, comment, tag and attach data to geographic features.
# Client-side
* [Morpho](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#tools): XML Metadata Client. Morpho allows researchers to create metadata, (i.e. describe their data in a standardized format), and create a catalog of data & metadata upon which to query, edit and view data collections.
* [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/): A free, open-source ontology editor and framework for building intelligent systems.
